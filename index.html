    <h1>Welcome to Linea Body</h1>
    <p class="editable">An increasing number of research studies show massage reduces heart rate, lowers blood pressure, increases blood circulation and lymph flow, relaxes muscles, improves range of motion, and increases endorphins (enhancing medical treatment). Although therapeutic massage does not increase muscle strength, it can stimulate weak, inactive muscles, and thus partially compensate for a lack of exercise and inactivity resulting from illness or injury. It can also hasten and lead to a more complete recovery from exercise or injury.<br /><br />Linea Body specializes in sports, deep tissue and rehabilitative-style massage, perfect for the weekend warrior or for those who want to maintain a healthy, active lifestyle, and increase longevity.&nbsp;</p>

        <h3> Sports <br /> Massage </h3>
        <p class="editable">Sports massage is specifically tailored to sporting injuries or ailments. It is not meant to be a relaxing massage and, indeed, can become quite vigorous at times. Contrary to its name, sports massage is not exclusively utilized by professional sportspeople or people that exercise heavily.</p>

        <i class="fa fa-leaf"></i>
        <h3> Deep Tissue Massage </h3>
        <p class="editable">Deep tissue massage therapy is similar to Swedish massage, but the deeper pressure is beneficial in releasing chronic muscle tension. The focus is on the deepest layers of muscle tissue, tendons and fascia.</p>

        <h3> Pre and Post Natal Massage </h3>
        <p class="editable">Massage therapy during pregnancy is a wonderful complementary choice for prenatal care. It is a healthy way to reduce stress and promote overall wellness. Massage relieves many of the normal discomforts experienced during pregnancy, such as backaches, stiff neck, leg cramps, headaches and<br />edema (or swelling)</p>

        <h3> Stretching and Flexibility </h3>
        <p class="editable">Stretching keeps muscles flexible, strong, and healthy.&nbsp; Flexibility is needed to maintain range of motion in the joints, and without which, the muscles shorten and become tight. When you call upon inflexible muscles for activity, they are weak and unable to extend all the way. Be sure to stay on the look-out for our foam rolling and stretching clinics.&nbsp;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="editable">
      I love, love, love Kendra. Many body workers --even those who specialize in sports massage-- are too "granola and incense," which makes me uncomfortable. Kendra is extremely professional without giving me that "touchy feely" feeling. Her knowledge and skill are unparalleled, and she is also actively involved in the community. -Claire L.

  <blockquote>
     <p class="editable">
    Kendra was able to perform a great deep tissue massage.  She made me feel very comfortable and relaxed throughout...was a great escape for the complete 60 minutes!  She has been doing it for years and although this was my first visit, I intend to get on a regular schedule with her. - Michael M.

  <blockquote>
    <p class="editable">
    She takes pride in her ability to get your muscles and your mind to relax. Her dedication to sports massage and intuition as well as listening skills (to your words and what your body is saying) makes her simply the best! -Theresa G.

  <div class="space"></div>
  <p class="no-padding editable" id="links">Kendra's journey to massage therapy started at Manhattan College, where she worked in the Athletic Training room under <a href="http://www.giants.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Remembering-Giants-Trainer-John-Johnson-1917-2016/f28517a1-958b-49c6-ae0a-153fcc781280">Dr. John Johnson.</a> It was there she combined knowledge gained from her Exercise Science/Sports Medicine degree with the lessons of massage learned from Doc. She continued her education at The Swedish Institute, where she acquired her NYS License. She began her practice at Equinox in NYC and then had a calling to move to California. A fresh start and a quick rise to the top in San Francisco allowed Kendra to win <a href="http://48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2011/07/26/best-bay-2011-readers-poll-city-living/?_sf_s=therapist&amp;post_date=04012011+09302011">'Best of the Bay' in 2011.</a> Having practiced now for over 10 years, she has had the opportunity to fine tune her craft, developing the ability to tailor-fit each session to meet clients' needs.&nbsp;</p>
